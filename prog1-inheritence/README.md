# Program 1: Inheritence
Since this  is a 179 review topic, we just need to double check you can do it.

Make the following classes and connect them _correctly_ with inheritance.  You can make any extra classes you need.  You don't need to force them in to one hierarchy if you don't want to.

Dog, Duck, Cat, Horse, Pigeon, Airplane, Fish, Car, Bicycle, Finch, Seahorse

You can put all the class declarations above main just this one time.  Don't need to turn in 30 files.

Add the following methods to the correct classes

Die, Drive, Eat, Fly, Speak,GetColor,
