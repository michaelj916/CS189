# Notes on last weeks homework: Vector.h
- Setting a **pointer** to `null` is **NOT** the same as deleting it
- Size is out of bounds, just like in arrays
```cpp
// 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
int arr[8];

arr[8] = 9; // crash
```
- Comment variables, functions, loops, and branches at most. At least, comment each "paragraph"

# Lists and Iterators
- Now istead of an array, picture a chain
- Each link in the chain holds one T
- You hold on to the two ends of the chain and not the middle links
- What can this ADT do?
	- Find first or last
	- Add to front or bakc
	- Remove front or back
	- Throw away the chian

## List's Contract
[Vector](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/)
[List](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/list/list/)
- The word "list" has no meaning since it is abstract. So we've decided that something with these methods at these speeds are "list"
	- Size in O(1)
	- Push or Pop Back in O(1)
	- Push or Pop Front in O(1)
	- get Front or Back in O(1)
	- List's get data At location in O(n)
	- List's find data in sorted list O(n)
	- Vector does those two in O(1), but does PushFront, Insert, and Erase in O(n) insetad of O(1). Find in O(log n).

## Implementation vs. Contract
- The definitions of List and Vector have no code in them
	- just results and Big O
- The details of how you write them are up to you
	- Information hiding !
- STL is the fastest speed with smallest memory

## Nodes
```cpp
// a doubly linked list
template<typename T>
class List
{
	struct ListNode
	{
	ListNode()
	{
	} 
	ListNode *mPrev;
	ListNode *mNext;	
	
	T mData;
	};

	ListNode *mHead;
	ListNode *mTail;
}
```
- Node is another avstract word with no *real* meaning
- Continuing with the chain analogy, a node is a link in the chain
- This struct is an "inner class" since it is defined inside the List class itself
	- That would normally make the name of the class "OuterClass::InnerClass" if in main
- But the struct is also private. It is just for us
	- Information hiding again! 

## Sentinel Nodes
```cpp
List()
{
mHead = new ListNode;
mTail = new ListNode;

mHead->mNext = mTail;
mTail->mPrev = mHead;
}
```
- When you have pointers, you have potential crashes
	- pointer to deleted node
	- node that links to nothing
- With no data in the list, Head and Tail would be `null`
 	- every operation would have to check for null
- A sentinel node is like a "hook" for the chian. It is a node that will always exist, but has no data
- Now every real node knows that htere is definitely a node on each side

## Pointer Management
`Reminder: ALWAYS DRAW A PICTURE!`
- Even with sentinels helping with nulls, you can still make problems yourself
- There is one rule that will help you you through this semester
	- `Draw a picture!`
- Draw a picture with boxes for nodes and arrows for pointers
- To add a new box and connect it in to the list you need to draw 4 arrows
	- So your code better have atleast 4 lines
- Removing a box requires 2 arrows

### TEST QUESTION
I have two pointers, A and B.  They are each pointing at valid nodes.  The next and prev  pointers of those nodes are correctly set up to make A and B adjacent.

I want to put a new node pointed at by C in between those two.  What is wrong with the code below?
```cpp
// In an Insert method
ListNode *C = new ListNode;
A->mNext = C;
B->mPrev = C;
```
- **A:** C's node doesn't point at anything
