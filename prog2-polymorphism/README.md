# Program 2: Polymorphism
This program will be as simple as I can make it since you'll have entire classes devoted to it in University.

1. Make Square and Circle classes.
2. Make a base class for both called Shape
3. Two methods: SetSize and GetArea
4. (Size of an edge for square and the radius for circle)
5. Put those two methods where you think they should go.  Avoid duplication and make sure Shape is polymorphic

#### To test these classes, do the following

1. Make a vector of Shape pointers
2. (If you haven't ever seen vectors, it's "std::vector<Shape*> shapes;")
3. Dynamically create some circles and squares and put them in the vector
4. (That's the push_back command.)
5. Loop through vector calling GetArea on each Shape
6. (The actual size of anything doesn't matter.  Don't waste your time making a menu and using input though.)
7. Make sure you have no memory leaks
